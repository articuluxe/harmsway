I think it's time to write about one of the amazing things that calc can do:
algebra!

Before we get into how to solve equations, I just want to write about on some
cool things you can do with the calc display.

Let's say you have a formula you want to work with =a + sqrt(b) =  5=. Let's enter
that into calc:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
M-x calc
'a + sqrt(b) = 5  (' starts algebraic mode).

Result:
1:  a + sqrt(b) = 5
#+END_EXAMPLE

Well, that's not so surprising, that's what we put in. Kind of disappointing,
though. Is that it calc? We love your brains, but what about your looks? That's
important too!

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
d B  (turn on calc-big-language mode)

Result:
         ___
1:  a + V b  = 5
#+END_EXAMPLE

Hey, that's an ASCII square-root symbol. What other cool things can you do here?

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
a^2

Result:

     2
1:  a

3:4   (enter the fraction 3/4)

Result:

    3
1:  -
    4
#+END_EXAMPLE

Here's how to get back:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
d N  (calc-normal-language)
#+END_EXAMPLE

And an alternative, in which all operators are explicitly represented as
functions:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
1:  a + sqrt(b) = 5  (re-enter the formula)
d U  (calc-unformatted-language)

Result:
1:  eq(add(a, sqrt(b)), 5)
#+END_EXAMPLE

But, wait, did you think that's all? What if you wanted to enter that equation
in Mathematica?

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
d M  (calc-mathematica-language)

Result:

1:  a + Sqrt[b] == 5
#+END_EXAMPLE

Ooh!  Calc!  Do c++ next!

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
d C  (calc-c-language)

1:  a + sqrt(b) == 5
#+END_EXAMPLE

Latex!

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
d L  (calc-latex-language)

Result:

1:  a + \sqrt{b} = 5
#+END_EXAMPLE

I could keep going, but trust me, there's more. And you can even define your own
languages by constructing syntax tables, but I won't get into that now.
