Note that I have distributed the “open source” versions. I have made changes to these in the past to meet customers’ requirements…

ReaderWriterLock (similar to the .net framework ReaderWriter class) – Microsoft platform dependent read/writer lock that uses critical section and reset events. It is very fast… Below is a link to CodeProject regarding this class:

blockallocator – Microsoft platform dependent block allocator for STL containers (allows block/chuck memory allocations in a container). Link is http://www.codeproject.com/KB/stl/blockallocator.aspx

HeightBalancedTree – Microsoft platform dependent very fast STL container (very fast insert/search). Link is http://www.codeproject.com/KB/architecture/avl_cpp.aspx?display=PrintAll&fid=244565&df=90&mpp=25&noise=3&sort=Position&view=Quick&select=1306445
