;;; Commentary:

;; This package provides the minor mode annotate-mode, which can add
;; annotations to arbitrary files without changing the files
;; themselves. Annotations are saved in the annotate-file
;; (~/.annotations by default).
;;
;; To add annotations to a file, select a region and hit C-c C-a. The
;; region will be underlined, and the annotation will be displayed in
;; the right margin. Annotations are saved whenever the file is saved.
;;
;; Use C-c ] to jump to the next annotation and C-c [ to jump to
;; the previous annotation. Use M-x annotate-export-annotations to
;; save annotations as a no-difference diff file.

existed in a text interval defined in the database
metadata (the database located in the file specified by the
variable 'annotate-file') and should just be
restored. Sometimes the annotated text (see above) can not be
found in said interval because the annotated file's content
changed and annotate-mode could not track the
changes (e.g. save the file when annotate-mode was not
active/loaded) in this case the matching
text ('annotated-text') is searched in a region surrounding the
interval and, if found, the buffer is annotated right there.

The searched interval can be customized setting the variable:
'annotate-search-region-lines-delta'.
