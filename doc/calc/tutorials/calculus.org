Quick, integrate =2x + sin(y)=! Well, frankly, it's been so long since I've done
calculus by hand I can't remember anymore. Well, knowing calculus is good, but
knowing calc is even more useful!

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
M-x calc
m r (switch to radians mode, which helps with keeping things simple)
'2x + sin(y)  (The single quote enters algebraic mode)
a i y  (Calculate the integral with respect to y)

Result
1:  2 x y - cos(y)
#+END_EXAMPLE

You can also integrate over specific regions by using =C-u a i=, whereupon it will
prompt you for the start and end point of the integration.

As the manual mentions, the results are often not as simplified as they could
be. Calc is impressive, but it isn't as sophisticated as Mathematica.

If we take the derivative of the integral we just calculated. We should get back
to our original formula.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
a d y  (Calculate the derivative with respect to y)

Result:
1:  2 x + sin(y)
#+END_EXAMPLE

Oh yeah! The system works, people! We can also make the Taylor series of a
function:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
a t y 6  (Calculate the Taylor series of a term, over y, for 6 terms)

Result:
1:  2 x + y - y^3 / 6 + y^5 / 120
#+END_EXAMPLE

We asked for 6 terms, but as the manual mentions, some terms may have
coefficient 0, so don't appear here.

As I mentioned, for simple things this works well, but Calc's power is limited.
However, the integration is customizable - you can write your own integration
rules when Calc is missing something. I haven't been able to find evidence that
anyone actually has done this in any add-on package, though. You, reader, can be
the first!
