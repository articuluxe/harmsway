;;; Commentary:

;; Casual is a collection of opinionated Transient-based keyboard driven user
;; interfaces for various built-in modes.

;; INSTALLATION

;; Casual is organized into different user interface (UI) libraries tuned for
;; different modes. Different user interfaces for the following modes are
;; supported:

;; - Agenda (Elisp library: `casual-agenda')
;;   An interface for Org Agenda to help you plan your day.
;;   URL `https://github.com/kickingvegas/casual/blob/main/docs/agenda.org'

;; - Bookmarks (Elisp library: `casual-bookmarks')
;;   An interface for editing your bookmark collection.
;;   URL `https://github.com/kickingvegas/casual/blob/main/docs/bookmarks.org'

;; - Calc (Elisp library: `casual-calc')
;;   An interface for Emacs Calc, an embarrasingly feature-rich calculator.
;;   URL `https://github.com/kickingvegas/casual/blob/main/docs/calc.org'

;; - Calendar (Elisp library: `casual-calendar')
;;   An interface for the built-in calendar and diary of Emacs.
;;   URL `https://github.com/kickingvegas/casual/blob/main/docs/calendar.org'

;; - Dired (Elisp library: `casual-dired')
;;   An interface for the venerable file manager Dired.
;;   URL `https://github.com/kickingvegas/casual/blob/main/docs/dired.org'

;; - EditKit (Elisp library: `casual-editkit')
;;   A cornucopia of interfaces for the different editing features (e.g.
;;   marking, copying, killing, duplicating, transforming, deleting) of Emacs.
;;   Included are interfaces for rectangle, register, macro, and project
;;   commands.
;;   URL `https://github.com/kickingvegas/casual/blob/main/docs/editkit.org'

;; - Image (Elisp library: `casual-image')
;;   An interface for viewing an image file with `image-mode'.
;;   Resizing an image is supported if ImageMagick 6 or 7 is installed. This
;;   interface deviates significantly with naming conventions used by
;;   `image-mode' to be more in alignment with conventional image editing tools.
;;   URL `https://github.com/kickingvegas/casual/blob/main/docs/image.org'

;; - Info (Elisp library: `casual-info')
;;   An interface for the Info documentation system.
;;   URL: `https://github.com/kickingvegas/casual/blob/main/docs/info.org'

;; - I-Search (Elisp library: `casual-isearch')
;;   An interface for the many commands supported by I-Search.
;;   URL: `https://github.com/kickingvegas/casual/blob/main/docs/isearch.org'

;; - Make (Elisp library: `casual-make')
;;   An interface to `make-mode'.
;;   URL: `https://github.com/kickingvegas/casual/blob/main/docs/make-mode.org'

;; - Re-Builder (Elisp library: `casual-re-builder')
;;   An interface for the Emacs regular expression tool.
;;   URL: `https://github.com/kickingvegas/casual/blob/main/docs/re-builder.org'

;; Users can choose any or all of the user interfaces made available by Casual
;; at their pleasure.

;; UPGRADING to Casual 2.x

;; If you have been using an earlier version 1.x of Casual, thank you. Please
;; use the following guidance:

;; * If you do not use `use-package' to configure Casual

;; Before installing Casual, you should update all of your existing Casual
;; packages. This is most easily done via the package menu buffer described in
;; info node `(emacs) Package Menu'. After updating your packages, install the
;; `casual' package.

;; Migrate your existing Casual packages from 1.x to 2.x by running the
;; following commands:

;; M-x load-library casual
;; M-x casual-upgrade-base-to-version-2

;; Any Casual v1.x packages that have been superseded by this package will be
;; uninstalled.

;; While not necessary, it is recommended to run `package-autoremove' to purge
;; any dangling dependent packages. Cautious readers can choose to audit any
;; packages that are targeted to be removed.

;; * If you have used `use-package' to configure Casual

;; For version 2.x going forward, I (Charles Choi) have decided to not offer any
;; documented guidance on using `use-package' to configure Casual due my lack of
;; expertise in using it. I leave it to more skilled readers to determine how to
;; best use it (described in info node `(use-package) Top') for their
;; configuration. Please also note that this is not a prohibition on using
;; `use-package' with Casual. I am simply admitting that I don't know how to use
;; it.

;; That said, if you have used :ensure t to install a superseded package, you
;; must remove that configuration. After doing so, please follow the above
;; instructions for installing `casual'.

;; If you are using Emacs â‰¤ 30.0, you will need to update the built-in package
;; `transient'. By default, `package.el' will not upgrade a built-in package.
;; Set the customizable variable `package-install-upgrade-built-in' to `t' to
;; override this. For more details, please refer to the "Install" section on
;; this project's repository web page.

;;; Code:
(require 'package)
(require 'casual-lib)

(defun casual-upgrade-base-to-version-2 (enable)
  "Upgrade base Casual packages to version 2 if ENABLE is t.

casual-agenda, casual-bookmarks, casual-calc, casual-dired,

Note that the package casual-lib will not be deleted if any of the packages
casual-suite, casual-avy, or casual-symbol-overlay is installed."
