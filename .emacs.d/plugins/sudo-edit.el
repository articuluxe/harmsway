;;; Commentary:

;; This file provides several utility functions for opening buffers
;; as root using 'sudo'.  They are:
;;
;;     `sudo-edit'
;;
;; Suggested keybinding:
;;
;;     (global-set-key (kbd "C-c C-r") 'sudo-edit)
;;
;; Installation:
;;
;; To use this mode, put the following in your init.el:
;;
;;     (require 'sudo-edit)

;;; Code:
(eval-when-compile
  (require 'subr-x))

(require 'tramp)

(defun sudo-edit-filename (file-name)
  "Return a sudo edit name for a FILE-NAME."
  (if (file-remote-p file-name)
      (let* ((vec (tramp-dissect-file-name file-name))
             (hop (tramp-make-tramp-file-name
                   (tramp-file-name-method vec)
                   (tramp-file-name-user vec)
                   (tramp-file-name-host vec)
                   ""
                   (tramp-file-name-hop vec))))
        (setq hop (string-remove-prefix tramp-prefix-format hop))
        (setq hop (string-remove-suffix tramp-postfix-host-format hop))
