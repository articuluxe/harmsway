Ever want to know how many seconds old David Hasselhoff is? calc can do many
things, but it doesn't know much about Hasselhoff, so first I do a query on
Google for [david hasselhoff]. I get a knowledge card on the right saying he was
born July 17, 1952. It doesn't give a time, so we'll just assume it was at
midnight.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
M-x calc
t N (put the current time on the stack)
'<Jul 17, 1952> (press ' to enter algebraic mode, then you input the date).
- (subtract the two to get the number of days David has been alive)
24 (we're going to multiply by 24, the number of hours in a day)
60 (the number of minutes in an hour)
60 (the number of seconds in a minute)

Final result:
1:  1910255938.01
#+END_EXAMPLE

There you have it, he's... wait, how many seconds?  That's really hard to read.

Back into calc!

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
d g (toggle digit grouping)

The final final result:
1:  1,910,255,938.01
#+END_EXAMPLE

Ah, that's a 1.9 billion seconds.  Sweet!
