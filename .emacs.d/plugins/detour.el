;;; Commentary:

;; This package allows you to remember your current cursor position,
;; go somewhere else and then jump between those two positions.  It is
;; meant for quick detours and then continuing your work where you
;; left off.

;; Suggested keybindings:
;; (global-set-key [(control \.)] 'detour-mark)
;; (global-set-key [(control \,)] 'detour-back)

;; Or via use-package:
;;
;; (use-package detour
;;   :bind
;;   ([(control \.)] . detour-mark)
;;   ([(control \,)] . detour-back))

;; Internally, a register is used to store the position.  If you
;; manually set this register, these functions will not work.
