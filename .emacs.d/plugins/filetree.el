;;; Commentary:

;; Filetree is a package that provides two basic functions:

;; File tree viewer
;;  The viewer displays a file list as a directory tree in a
;;  special buffer.  The file list can be populated from any list of files.
;;  There are functions to populate from a number of common sources: recentf,
;;  files in buffer-list, files in the current directory, and files found
;;  recursively in the current directory.  Within the viewer, the file list can
;;  be filtered and expanded in various ways and operations can be performed on
;;  the filtered file list (e.g., grep over files in list).  Multiple file lists
;;  can be saved and retrieved between sessions.
;;
;; File notes
;;  The file notes enables the user to write and display (org-mode) notes
;;  associated with individual files and directories.  The note can be displayed
;;  in a side buffer either when cycling through files in the file tree viewer
;;  or when the file is open in a buffer.  The notes are kept in a single org-mode
;;  file with a heading for each file/directory.
;;
;; To use add the following to your ~/.emacs:
;; (require 'filetree')
;;
;; Use one of the following to run filetree for a common use case:
;; M-x filetree-show-recentf-files
;; M-x filetree-show-cur-dir
;; M-x filetree-show-cur-dir-recursively
;; M-x filetree-show-cur-buffers
