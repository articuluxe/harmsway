;;; Commentary:
;;
;; The Emacs theme Tomorrow Night Deepblue is a beautiful deep blue variant of
;; the Tomorrow Night theme, which is renowned for its elegant color
;; palette that is pleasing to the eyes.
;;
;; The Tomorrow Night Deepblue features a deep blue background color that
;; creates a calming atmosphere. The contrasting colors make it easy to
;; distinguish between different elements of your code. The
;; tomorrow-night-deepblue theme is also a great choice for programmer who miss
;; the blue themes that were trendy a few years ago.
