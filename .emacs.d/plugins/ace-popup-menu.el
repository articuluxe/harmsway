;;; Commentary:

;; This package allows to replace GUI popup menu (created by `x-popup-menu'
;; by default) with little temporary window (like that in which Dired shows
;; you files you want to copy). In this window, menu items are displayed and
;; labeled with one or two letters. You press a key corresponding to desired
;; choice (or C-g) and you are done.

With a prefix argument ARG, enable `ace-popup-menu mode' if ARG
is positive, and disable it otherwise.  If called from Lisp,
enable the mode if ARG is omitted or NIL, and toggle it if ARG is
`toggle'.

This minor mode is global. When it's active any call to
`x-popup-menu' will result in call of `ace-popup-menu'
instead. This function in turn implements more efficient
interface to select an option from a list. Emacs Lisp code can
also use `ace-popup-menu' directly, in this case it will work OK
even if the mode is disabled."
