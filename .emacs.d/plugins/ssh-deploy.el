;;; Commentary:

;; ssh-deploy enables automatic deploys on explicit-save actions, manual uploads, renaming,
;; deleting, downloads, file and directory differences, launching remote terminals (eshell, shell),
;; detection of remote changes, remote directory browsing, remote SQL database sessions and
;; running custom deployment scripts via TRAMP.
;;
;; For asynchronous operations it uses package `async.el'.
;;
;; By setting the variables (globally, per directory or per file):
;; ssh-deploy-root-local,ssh-deploy-root-remote, ssh-deploy-on-explicit-save
;; you can setup a directory for TRAMP deployment.
;;
;; For asynchronous transfers you need to setup ~/.netrc, ~/.authinfo or ~/.authinfo.gpg or key-based authorization or equivalent for automatic authentication.
;;
;; Example contents of ~/.netrc, ~/.authinfo or ~/.authinfo.gpg for password-based interaction-free authentication:
;; machine myserver.com login myuser port ftp password mypassword
;; machine myserver2.com login myuser2 port ssh password mypassword2
;; machine myserver3.com login myuser3 port sftp password mypassword3
;;
;; Set permissions to this file to 600 with your user as the owner.
;;
;; - To setup a upload hook on save do this:
;;     (add-hook 'after-save-hook (lambda() (if (and (boundp 'ssh-deploy-on-explicit-save) ssh-deploy-on-explicit-save) (ssh-deploy-upload-handler)) ))
;;
;; - To setup automatic storing of base revisions and detection of remote changes do this:
;;     (add-hook 'find-file-hook (lambda() (if (and (boundp 'ssh-deploy-automatically-detect-remote-changes) ssh-deploy-automatically-detect-remote-changes) (ssh-deploy-remote-changes-handler)) ))
;;
;; - To set key-bindings do something like this:
;;     (global-set-key (kbd "C-c C-z f") (lambda() (interactive)(ssh-deploy-upload-handler-forced) ))
;;     (global-set-key (kbd "C-c C-z u") (lambda() (interactive)(ssh-deploy-upload-handler) ))

;;     (global-set-key (kbd "C-c C-z H") (lambda() (interactive)(ssh-deploy-remote-terminal-shell-handler) ))
;;     (global-set-key (kbd "C-c C-z R") (lambda() (interactive)(ssh-deploy-rename-handler) ))
;;     (global-set-key (kbd "C-c C-z e") (lambda() (interactive)(ssh-deploy-remote-changes-handler) ))
;;     (global-set-key (kbd "C-c C-z b") (lambda() (interactive)(ssh-deploy-browse-remote-base-handler) ))
;;     (global-set-key (kbd "C-c C-z B") (lambda() (interactive)(ssh-deploy-browse-remote-handler) ))

;; * `ssh-deploy-exclude-list' - A list defining what paths to exclude from deployment *(list)*
;; * `ssh-deploy-async' - Enables asynchronous transfers (you need to have `async.el` installed as well) *(boolean)*
;; * `ssh-deploy-remote-sql-database' - Default database when connecting to remote SQL database *(string)*
;; * `ssh-deploy-remote-sql-password' - Default password when connecting to remote SQL database *(string)*
;; * `ssh-deploy-remote-sql-port' - Default port when connecting to remote SQL database *(integer)*

;; * `ssh-deploy-remote-sql-user' - Default user when connecting to remote SQL database *(string)*
;; * `ssh-deploy-remote-shell-executable' - Default shell executable when launching shell on remote host
;; * `ssh-deploy-verbose' - Show messages in message buffer when starting and ending actions, default t *(boolean)*
;; * `ssh-deploy-script' - Our custom lambda function that will be called using (funcall) when running deploy script
