Did you know you could work with strings in calc? For an example, let's find out
what "Hello world" is in binary:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
M-x calc
d 2 (change the to binary mode)
"Hello world (Enter the string "Hello world" which turns into a vector of numbers)

Result:
1:  [2#1001000, 2#1100101, 2#1101100, 2#1101100, 2#1101111, 2#100000, 2#1110111, 2#1101111, 2#1110010, 2#1101100, 2#1100100]
#+END_EXAMPLE

And similarly, we can convert back. If someone gave you the binary number:
=01001000011011110110110001100001= and asked what the string was, I'd have no
idea... but calc knows:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
d " (changes to string mode)
C-x b scratch   (whaaa, leave calc?)
01001000011011110110110001100001  (enter the number we're parsing)
C-a  (go to the start of the line)
C-x (  (start a macro)
2# (prefix the number with a binary indicator)
C-u 8 C-f  (Jump forward 8 characters)
<space>  (insert a space to separate the numbers)
C-x )  (end the macro)
C-x e  (repeat the macro)
e e  (repeat twice twice more)
C-<space>  (set mark)
C-a  (goto beginning of line)
C-x <asterisk> g  (copy region into calc)

Result:

1:  "Hola"
#+END_EXAMPLE

And there you have it! Maybe there is an easier way to convert from the giant
binary number to a vector of bytes, but I don't know it yet.
