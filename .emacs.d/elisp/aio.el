;;; aio.el --- async/await for Emacs Lisp -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;; This is free and unencumbered software released into the public domain.

;;; Commentary:

;; The main components of this package are `aio-defun' / `aio-lambda'
;; to define async function, and `aio-await' to pause these functions
;; while they wait on asynchronous events. When an asynchronous
;; function is paused, the main thread is not blocked. It is no more
;; or less powerful than callbacks, but is nicer to use.

;; This is implementation is based on Emacs 25 generators, and
;; asynchronous functions are actually iterators in disguise, operated
;; as stackless, asymmetric coroutines.
