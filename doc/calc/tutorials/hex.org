OK, seems like there's interest in some quick calc tips. Here's today's:

How to convert decimal to hexidecimal. Let's say you want to convert number
12345 to hex.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
M-x calc
d 6 (sets the number radix to 16, meaning all output will be in hex)
10#12345 (inputs the number 12345 in base 10)

The output reads:
1:  16#3039
#+END_EXAMPLE

The answer is therefore =0x3039=.

And then you can do a =d 0= to set the number radix back to normal, base 10.

Here's how to do the other way.  Let's convert =0xABCDEF= to base 10.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
M-x calc
16#ABCDEF

The output reads:
1:  11259375
#+END_EXAMPLE
