This one is pretty short, but it's about one of my favorite features of calc:
the ability to handle fractions as fractions instead of rendering them as real
numbers.

Quick, what's =5/8 + 9/21=?

Um, ok... better start multiplying things... wait, let's just tell calc to do
it.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
M-x calc
5:8  (this is how you enter a fraction)
9:21 
+

Result:
1:  59/56
#+END_EXAMPLE

So easy! If we want to convert it to a float you can do this: 

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
c f (convert to
float)

Result:

1:  1.05357142857*10.^0
#+END_EXAMPLE

And if you want it back as a fraction, then just do:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
c F  (convert to fraction)

Result:

1:  59/56 
#+END_EXAMPLE

That's so awesome!

You could also enter fractions this way:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
m f  (set fraction mode, integer division will result in fractions)
5
8
/

Result:

1:  5/8
#+END_EXAMPLE

Now you can live in the nice world of fractions as much as you like. It's a nice
world, full of pleasant to look at integers taking up little horizontal space
