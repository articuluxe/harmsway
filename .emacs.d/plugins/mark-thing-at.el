;;; Commentary:

;; This package tracks and creates bindings for region marking functions found
;; in `thingatpt'.  The library adds on functionality that:
;; * Generates functions that marks *things* (per the parlance of
;;   `thingatpt.el` library).
;; * Creates a mode-map and bindings to make it easy to mark (create a region
;;   around) a word, URL, file, number, symbol etc (see the [usage](#usage)
;;   section).
;; * Adds a *number thing*, which allows for traversing and marking numbers.

When called interactively, toggle `mark-thing-at-mode'.  With
prefix ARG, enable `mark-thing-at-mode' if ARG is positive,
otherwise disable it.

When called from Lisp, enable `mark-thing-at-mode' if ARG is
omitted, nil or positive.  If ARG is `toggle', toggle
`mark-thing-at-mode'.  Otherwise behave as if called
interactively.

When turned on, bind keys to a set of function that mark a
pattern at the current point.  These patterns include symbols,
URLs, files, etc.
