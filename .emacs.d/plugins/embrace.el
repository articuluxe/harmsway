;; Add/Change/Delete pairs based on [expand-region].


;; [expand-region] https://github.com/magnars/expand-region.el


;; 1 Overview
;; ==========

;;   This package is heavily inspired by [evil-surround] (which is a port
;;   of the vim plugin [surround.vim]). But instead of using `evil' and its
;;   text objects, this package relies on another excellent package
;;   [expand-region].

;;   For Emacs users who don't like `evil' and thus don't use
;;   `evil-surround', `embrace' provides similar commands that can be found
;;   in `evil-surround'. `Evil' is absolutely *not* required. For
;;   `evil-surround' users, `embrace' can make your `evil-surround'
;;   commands even better! (Have you noticed that `evil-surround' doesn't
;;   work on many custom pairs?)


;; [evil-surround] https://github.com/timcharper/evil-surround

;; [surround.vim] https://github.com/tpope/vim-surround

;; [expand-region] https://github.com/magnars/expand-region.el


;; 2 Usage
;; =======

;;   There are three commands: `embrace-add', `embrace-change' and
;;   `embrace-delete' that can add, change, and delete surrounding pairs
;;   respectively. You can bind these commands to your favorite key
;;   bindings.

;;   There is also a dispatch command `embrace-commander'. After invoking
;;   `embrace-commander', you can hit:
;;   - `a' for `embrace-add'
;;   - `c' for `embrace-change'
;;   - `d' for `embrace-delete'


;; 2.1 Example
;; ~~~~~~~~~~~

;;   It might be a little hard for users who have no experience in `evil'
;;   and `evil-surround' to understand what `embrace' can do. So let's give
;;   an example to show what `embrace' can do fist. You can look at the
;;   following sections to see the meaning of key bindings. In this
;;   example, I bind C-, to `embrace-commander'. Assume we have following
;;   text in `c-mode' and the cursor position is indicated by `|':
;;   ,----
;;   | fo|o
;;   `----

;;   Press C-, a w ' to add '' to the current word:
;;   ,----
;;   | 'fo|o'
;;   `----

;;   Press C-, a q { to add {} to outside of the quotes:
;;   ,----
;;   | {'fo|o'}
;;   `----

;;   Press C-, c ' " to change the '' to "":
;;   ,----
;;   | {"fo|o"}
;;   `----

;;   Press C-, c { t, and then enter the tag: body class="page-body", to
;;   change the {} to a tag:
;;   ,----
;;   | <body class="page-body">"fo|o"</body>
;;   `----

;;   Press C-, c t f, and enter the function name `bar' to change the tag
;;   to a function call:
;;   ,----
;;   | bar("fo|o")
;;   `----

;;   Press C-, d f to remove the function call:
;;   ,----
;;   | "fo|o"
;;   `----

;;   If you're an `evil-surround' user, you might notice that the last
;;   command can't be achieved by `evil-surround'. However, it works in
;;   `embrace'! And yes, you can find even more examples in which
;;   `evil-surround' doesn't work while `embrace' works!


;; 2.2 `embrace-change' and `embrace-delete'
;; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

;;   These two commands can change and delete the surround pair
;;   respectively. For `evil-surround' users, `embrace-change' is similar
;;   to `cs' and `embrace-delete' is similar to `ds'.

;;   The surrounding pair is specified by a key, which is very similar to
;;   the key used for Vim's text objects. For example, `(' stands for the
;;   surrounding pair `(' and `)', and `{' stands for the surrouding pair,
;;   `{' and `}'. The default key mappings are shown below:
;;    Key  Left             right
;;   --------------------------------
;;    (    "("              ")"
;;    )    "( "             " )"
;;    {    "{"              "}"
;;    }    "{ "             " }"
;;    [    "["              "]"
;;    ]    "[ "             " ]"
;;    >    "<"              ">"
;;    "    "\""             "\""
;;    '    "\'"             "\'"
;;    t    "<foo bar=100>"  "</foo>"
;;    f    "func("          ")"

;;   Note that for `t' and `f' key, the real content is based on the user's
;;   input.


;; 2.3 `embrace-add'
;; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

;;   This command is similar to `evil-surround''s `ys' command. We need to
;;   enter a key for the semantic unit to which we want to add a
;;   surrounding pair. The semantic unit is marked by the functions
;;   provided by `expand-region'.

;;   Here is the default mapping:
;;    key  mark function
;;   -----------------------------
;;    w    er/mark-word
;;    s    er/mark-symbol
;;    d    er/mark-defun
;;    p    er/mark-outside-pairs
;;    P    er/mark-inside-pairs
;;    q    er/mark-outside-quotes
;;    Q    er/mark-inside-quotes
;;    .    er/mark-sentence
;;    h    er/mark-paragraph

;;   After pressing a key to select the semantic unit, you can press
;;   another key to add the surrounding pair, which is the same as
;;   `embrace-change' and `embrace-delete'.


;; 3 Customization
;; ===============

;; 3.1 Adding More Semantic Units
;; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

;;   You can modify the variable `embrace-semantic-units-alist' and note
;;   that this variable is buffer-local so it is better to change the value
;;   in a hook:
;;   ,----
;;   | (add-hook 'text-mode-hook
;;   |     (lambda ()
;;   |        (add-to-list 'embrace-semantic-units-alist '(?e . er/mark-email))))
;;   `----


;; 3.2 Adding More Surrounding Pairs
;; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

;;   Use the command `embrace-add-pair' to add a pair:
;;   ,----
;;   | (embrace-add-pair key left right)
;;   `----

;;   The change is also buffer-local, so wrap it in a hook function:
;;   ,----
;;   | (add-hook 'LaTeX-mode-hook
;;   |     (lambda ()
;;   |        (embrace-add-pair ?e "\\begin{" "}")))
;;   `----

;;   If you want add something like the `t' key for the tag, you can look
;;   at the function `embrace-add-pair-regexp' in the source code.

;;   Note that if you're using `embrace-add-pair' to add an existing key,
;;   then it will replace the old one.


;; 3.3 Example Settings
;; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

;;   I recommend binding a convenient key for `embrace-commander'. For
;;   example,
;;   ,----
;;   | (global-set-key (kbd "C-,") #'embrace-commander)
;;   `----

;;   We have defined several example hook functions that provide additional
;;   key bindings which can be used in different major modes. Right now
;;   there are hooks for `LaTeX-mode' and `org-mode':

;;   `LaTeX-mode':
;;    Key  Left      Right
;;   ----------------------
;;    =    \verb |   |
;;    ~    \texttt{  }
;;    *    \textbf{  }

;;   `org-mode':
;;    Key  Left  Right
;;   ------------------
;;    =    =     =
;;    ~    ~     ~
;;    *    *     *
;;    _    _     _
;;    +    +     +

;;   To use them:
;;   ,----
;;   | (add-hook 'LaTeX-mode-hook 'embrace-LaTeX-mode-hook)
;;   | (add-hook 'org-mode-hook 'embrace-org-mode-hook)
;;   `----

;;   Welcome to add some settings for more major modes.


;; 4 For `evil-surround' Users
;; ===========================

;; 4.1 Where `embrace' is better
;; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

;;   From the previous example, you can see that `embrace' actually
;;   replicates all the funcionalities provided in `evil-surround' and it
;;   can even do more than `evil-surround'. Actually, they are quite
;;   different. Since `embrace' uses `expand-region' behind the scene, you
;;   can expect it to work as long as `expand-region' works. Unlike
;;   `evil-surround', which is restricted to the pre-defined text objects,
;;   `embrace' can define nearly arbitrary surrounding pairs and three core
;;   commands always work. On the contratry, you get nearly no
;;   customization in `evil-surround': custom pairs don't work in `cs' or
;;   `ds' if you don't have a corresponding text object defined (they work
;;   in `ys').

;;   *TL;DR*: `embrace' is more customizable.


;; 4.2 Where `evil-surround' is better
;; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

;;   `expand-region' works on semantic units, which can be different in
;;   different major modes, which causes `embrace' to have different
;;   behaviors in differnt major modes. However, `evil-surround' is based
;;   on text objects. You can expect it to have the same behavior in
;;   different major modes.

;;   Assume the following text in `LaTeX-mode':
;;   ,----
;;   | a<foo>{ ba|r }</foo>a
;;   `----

;;   Using `embrace', it is impossible to find the tag `<foo>' and `</foo>'
;;   since they are not meaningfun under `LaTeX-mode' so `expand-region'
;;   would not consider the tag as a semantic unit. Therefore,
;;   `embrace-delete' can not delete the tag (it *does* work if you delete
;;   the letter =a=s at both ends).

;;   However, if you change the major mode to `html-mode', `embrace' works
;;   since now the `<foo>' tag becomes meaningful in current context.

;;   In both situations, `evil-surround' can work because `tag' is an evil
;;   text object that has already been defined.

;;   If you're a programmer, you probably always work on some blocks that
;;   are meaningful in the current context. From this point of view,
;;   `embrace''s behavior makes more sense.


;; 4.3 Why not use together?
;; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

;;   Sure! You can make `embrace' and `evil-surround' work together.

;;   Use the following command to enable the integration:
;;   ,----
;;   | (embrace-enable-evil-surround-integration)
;;   `----

;;   And use `embrace-disable-evil-surround-integration' to disable.

;;   The idea is that `evil-surround' works great if there are already text
;;   objects defined. So when users press a key that can be mapped to a
;;   text object, it is handled by `evil-surround'. Otherwise, let
;;   `embrace' handle it.

;;   The keys that are processed by `evil-surround' are saved in the
;;   variable `embrace-evil-surround-key'. The default value is:
;;   ,----
;;   | (?\( ?\[ ?\{ ?\) ?\] ?\} ?\" ?\' ?b ?B ?t)
;;   `----

;;   Note that this variable is also buffer-local. You should change it in
;;   the hook:
;;   ,----
;;   | (add-hook 'LaTeX-mode-hook
;;   |     (lambda ()
;;   |        (add-to-list 'embrace-evil-surround-key ?o)))
;;   `----

;;   Only these keys saved in the variable are processed by
;;   `evil-surround', and all the other keys will be processed by
;;   `embrace'. You can customize `embrace' in the way described in the
;;   previous *Customization* section to add support for additional pairs.

;; ===============

;;   This package is still in early stage, but it is quite usable right
;;   now. More functions can be added and the evil integration is not
;;   perfect yet. Contributions are always welcome!
