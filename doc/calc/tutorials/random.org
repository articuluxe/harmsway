I use calc whenever I need a random number. The interface is easy and the random
numbers are (supposedly) high quality.

So, let's start with something simple: A random number between 0 and 100:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
M-x calc
100 (the upper bound, all values will be between 0 and this)
k r (creates a random number between 0 and the number on the stack)

Result:
1:  66  (of course, yours will be different)
#+END_EXAMPLE

I want another one!
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
k a (creates another number with the same upper bound as the last)
#+END_EXAMPLE

Now that Iâ€™ve had a taste of that sweet sweet randomness, I want a vector of 50!

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
100 (the upper bound, again)
50 (the number to generate)
k h (generate a vector of 50 random numbers between 0 and 100)

1:  [60, 72, 61, 74, 77, 97, 10, 90, 8, 29, 82, 81, 51, 58, 7, 88, 99, 1, 37, 89, 93, 84, 52, 94, 2, 35, 5, 48, 87, 47, 14, 6, 79, 18, 67, 76, 70, 9, 43, 65, 69, 23, 55, 11, 53, 78, 50, 30, 13, 42]
#+END_EXAMPLE

OK, that's nice.  But how about a number between 0 and 1?

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
1.0
k r 

Result:
1:  0.636988102539
#+END_EXAMPLE

OK, how about number between -50 and 50? For that we need to use what calc calls
an interval form:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
[ (Starts interval form)
50 (You can't just type -50 in calc)
n (negate, givint -50)
.. (the middle part of the interval form)
50] (closing the interval form)
#+END_EXAMPLE

What you see now in calc is:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
[-50 .. 50]
#+END_EXAMPLE
And you could have just typed it in with:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
'[-50 .. 50]
#+END_EXAMPLE
which would be a lot easier, really.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
k r
#+END_EXAMPLE
This produces a random number from the bounds of the interval, in this case both
-50 and 50 are possible, if you wanted them to be exlusive bounds, you'd use the
form =(-50 .. 50)=.

Finally, you can re-arrange a list: 
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
'[1 2 3 4] (our starting vector) 
-1 (signals to use the vector above, could also be the size of the vector) 
k h

Result:
1:  [3, 1, 4, 2]
#+END_EXAMPLE

But =k a= will not give you more variants, unfortunately.
