Hey, what's the time? It's time to get ill! No, actually I meant the time in
seconds since the epoch. Yesterday I went over doing math with time, which is
fun but not something I use everyday. Much more useful is converting to and from
Unix timestamps.

Let's start by getting the time now in seconds since the epoch:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
M-x calc
t N (get the time now)
t U (convert the time to seconds since the epoch)

Result:
1:  1359424746
#+END_EXAMPLE

Oh, and you want to insert that into your last used buffer?

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
y (that doesn't mean "yes", that means yank into the last buffer)
#+END_EXAMPLE

Done!  Just to be complete, let's convert another date we have to input:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
'<12:00pm Jul 4, 1776> (single quote to enter algebraic mode, then the date)
t U (converts the time to seconds since the epoch)
#+END_EXAMPLE

But wait, what will happen?  This is considerably before the epoch.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Result:
1:  -6106003200
#+END_EXAMPLE

Oh calc, you never let me down.

Let's do the other way.  Remember the Billenium?

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
1e9
t U (converts the time in seconds since the epoch to text)

Result:
1:  <9:46:40pm Sat Sep 8, 2001>
#+END_EXAMPLE

Wow, I never realized how close the Billenium was to September 11th.  Kind of spooky...
