I recently chatted with emacspeak creator T.V. Raman, and told him I was
writing a series of short tutorials about calc. He is really a calc fanatic, and
told me a story in which he astounded a loan officer by calculating scheduled
loan payments with just a few keystrokes in calc. Raman is living proof that
calc is a useful tool for so many situations, and it always pays to have emacs
running. He also mentioned that he found the explanation in the calc tutorial
about the financial functions to be the clearest he's ever read.

So, yes, calc can do finance. Let's say that you were sitting in front of a loan
officer, and she told you that for your loan of $500,000, you need to pay in 30
installments with a 5% interest rate. How much do you need to pay each month?
Wait a second! Stop right there, loan officer! I have calc!

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
M-x calc
500000  (the amount of the loan)
30   (the number of payments)
'5%  (equivalent to typing 0.05)
b M  (calc-fin-pmt, computing the amount of periodic payments to amortize a loan)

Result:
1:  25,000
#+END_EXAMPLE

OK, but that's a bit obvious, since $25,000 is just 5% of $500,000. If the
number of payments was much smaller, we'd get a larger value. Let's take another
question: if you wanted to only pay $10,000 in each installment? How many
installments would it take to pay off the loan?

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
'5%
10000  (the payment we want to make)
500000  (the loan amount)
b #  (calc-fin-nper, calculate the number of installments needed)

Result
1:  nper(0.05, 10,000, 500,000)
#+END_EXAMPLE

What? Oh, I see, I also go the message: "Payment too small to cover interest
rate: 10000". Oh, right, 5% of $500,000 is already $25,000, so we'd never pay it
off at that rate. What if we payed $50,000 instead?

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
'5%
50000  (the payment we want to make)
500000  (the loan amount)
b #

Result:
1: 14.2066908
#+END_EXAMPLE

So, it would take just over 14 payments to pay off the loan.

OK, one more cool one: Let's say you meet an investment banker who gives you the
following deal. I've got a investment for you, she says. Just give me $100,000
and I'll give you $10,000 at the end of each year for the next 12 years.
Assuming the interest rate will stay at 3% for the next 12 years. Is it a good
deal?

Hey, what are you asking me for? I have no idea! Calc knows, though, because it
can tell you the break-even point for the cost of an investment that gives
periodic payments.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
'3%  (the interest rate)
12  (the number of payments)
10000  (the payment you get each time)
b P  (calc-fin-pv, calculate the "present value" of the investment, the break-even point for the investment)

Result:
1:  99,540.0399357
#+END_EXAMPLE

In other words, the break-even point for the initial cost is $99,540. If the
investment costs more than this, it's no good at that assumed interest rate.
Better reject the deal. Trust calc more than any investment banker.

This is just a small sampling of some of the financial calculations that calc
can perform. The next time you are making an investment, fire up calc. You'll
not only have confidence in the deal, you may just amaze someone with the power
of emacs, just like T.V. Raman did.
