;; Commentary:

;; To install:
;;
;; Arrange for this file to be evaluated on start, for instance by
;; putting it into your ".emacs" or linking it into
;; ".emacs.d/site-start.d/" if you use my-site-start (which I highly
;; recommend)

;; Customize each entry in auto-insert-alist that you want to use this with.
;; 
;; M-x customize-apropos RET auto-insert-alist
;;
;; Let's say, for example, C and C++ headers, and you are storing
;; templates in `auto-insert-c-header-alist'.
;;
;; Find or create an entry that begins with something like 
;; (("\\.\\([Hh]\\|hh\\|hpp\\)\\'" . "C / C++ header")
;;      )

;; Replace it with:
;;
;; (("\\.\\([Hh]\\|hh\\|hpp\\)\\'" . "C / C++ header")
;;      lambda nil (auto-insert-choose-and-call auto-insert-c-header-alist))
;;
;; Adapt the string and `auto-insert-c-header-alist' appropriately to
;; the type of file.  See the `auto-insert-alist' docs for format.

;; You may want to add an entry to auto-insert-c-header-alist that
;; copies the original template so it's still available.

;;
;; To create templates:

;;  Use `auto-insert-choose-add-entry'; see its documentation.
