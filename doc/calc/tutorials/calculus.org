Quick, integrate =2x + sin(y)=! Well, frankly, it's been so long since I've done
calculus by hand I can't remember anymore. Well, knowing calculus is good, but
knowing calc is even more useful!

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
M-x calc
'2x + sin(y)  (The single quote enters algebraic mode)
a i y  (Calculate the integral with respect to y)

Result
1:  2 x y - 180 cos(y) / pi
#+END_EXAMPLE

You can also integrate over specific regions by using C-u a i, whereupon it will
prompt you for the start and end point of the integration.

As the manual mentions, the results are often not as simplified as they could
be. Calc is impressive, but it isn't as sophisticated as Mathematica.

An example of some issues are if we just take the derivative of the integral we
just calculated. We should get back to our original formula.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
a d y  (Calculate the derivative with respect to y)

Result:
1:  2 x + 3.14159265358 sin(y) / pi
#+END_EXAMPLE

Clearly this should be 2x + sin(y), but calc may have made an error.

OK, let's make calc do something cool so we can forget this unfortunate
incident. Hey, how about making a Taylor series of a function?

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
'2x + sin(y) (re-enter the formula)
a t y 6  (Calculate the Taylor series of a term, over y, for 6 terms)

Result:
1:  2 x + y - y^3 / 6 + y^5 / 120 - y^7 / 5040 + y^9 / 362880
#+END_EXAMPLE

This isn't a bad approximation, see [[https://www.google.com/search?q=y+-+y%5E3+%2F+6+%2B+y%5E5+%2F+120+-+y%5E7+%2F+5040+%2B+y%5E9+%2F+362880][Googleâ€™s answer]] for comparison.

So, yes, calc can do college-level math, even if the answers aren't perfectly
simplified. It's not Mathematica, but it is free and integrated into emacs, so
it's definitely nice to have.
