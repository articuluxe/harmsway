;;; Commentary:
;;
;;    This package provides a method to define multiple functions to
;;    be performed for the same keypress. You can use this as a
;;    convenience feature to toggle among several functions. It was
;;    originally written as the back-end for package `home-end',
;;    allowing those two keys to smartly cycle between moving POINT to
;;    the beginning/end of a line, the beginning/end of the window,
;;    the beginning/end of the buffer, and back to POINT.
;;
;;    Create a function which calls `keypress-multi-event' with a list
;;    of the functions to be associated with the keypress, and bind
;;    that keypress to that function. By default, subsequent
;;    keypresses cycle through the list, but you can change that
;;    behavior by optionally adding an index into the list as a second
;;    argument, or you could also directly manipulate the underlying
;;    buffer-local variable `keypress-multi-event--state'. Both
;;    methods are illustrated in package `home-end'.

;;; Code:

(defvar-local keypress-multi-event--state 0)

;;;###autoload
(defun keypress-multi-event (reactions &optional force-this-one)
  "Respond to repeated keyboard-events based upon the number of repetitions.

REACTIONS is a list of functions through which to cycle.

The optional arg FORCE-THIS-ONE is an integer index into REACTIONS.

This function was originally written to support functions
`home-end-home' and `home-end-end' in package `home-end.el'. See
there for a usage example."
