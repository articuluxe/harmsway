Jim is 42 years old. He has one brother, and their total age is 100. What is the
brother's age? OK, this isn't a very hard problem, but let's just introduce calc
algebra by solving it.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
M-x calc
'42 + x = 100  (' to enter algebraic input)
a S x  (solve for x)

Result:
1:  x = 58
#+END_EXAMPLE

Let's make this harder. Jim and Dan's ages sum to 100. Jim is 5 years older than
Dan. How old are they?

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
'[j + d = 100, d + 5 = j]
a S j,d

Result:
1:  [j = 52.5, d = 47.5]
#+END_EXAMPLE

Nice!

And of course it can give you more than just numerical solutions:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
'sin(x) + tan(y) = pi / 2
a S y  (solve for y)

Result:
1:  y = arctan(pi / 2 - sin(x))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Sometimes there are more than one solution.  For example:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
'x^2 = 25
a S x

Result:
1:  x = 5
#+END_EXAMPLE

Wait, what happened to -5! That's a valid solution, why didn't calc tell us
about it? What's happening here is that calc is telling us about the first valid
thing it can find, which is basically how it operates. But you can always get
everything:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
'x^2 = 25
a P x  (find the polynomial solutions)

Result:
1:  [5, -5]
#+END_EXAMPLE

Sometimes there aren't a finite number of results because you aren't dealing
with polynomials. You can just get a generalized solution:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
'sin(x)^2 = 25
H a S x  (solve for x, giving the generalized solution)

Result:
1:  x = arcsin(5 s1) (-1)^n1 + 180 n1
#+END_EXAMPLE

This uses the calc notation =n1=, which you just means any integer. You can also
see another notation =s1= which means any sign. In this case =5 s1= means that that
number can be 5 or -5.

Looking at how awesome calc is, it's just a shame I never knew about it in high
school...
