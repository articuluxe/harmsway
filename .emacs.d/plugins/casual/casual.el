;;; Commentary:

;; Casual is a collection of opinionated Transient-based keyboard driven user
;; interfaces for various built-in modes.

;; Casual is organized into different user interface (UI) libraries tuned for
;; different modes. Different user interfaces for the following modes are
;; supported:

;; - Agenda (Elisp library: `casual-agenda.el')
;;   An interface for Org Agenda to help you plan your day.

;; - BibTeX (Elisp library: `casual-bibtex.el')
;;   An interface for editing your BibTeX file.

;; - Bookmarks (Elisp library: `casual-bookmarks.el')
;;   An interface for editing your bookmark collection.

;; - Calc (Elisp library: `casual-calc.el')
;;   An interface for Emacs Calc, an embarrasingly feature-rich calculator.

;; - Calendar (Elisp library: `casual-calendar.el')
;;   An interface for the built-in calendar and diary of Emacs.

;; - Compile (Elisp library: `casual-compile.el')
;;   An interface for the output of the `compile' and Grep commands.

;; - Dired (Elisp library: `casual-dired.el')
;;   An interface for the venerable file manager Dired.

;; - EditKit (Elisp library: `casual-editkit.el')
;;   A cornucopia of interfaces for the different editing features (e.g.
;;   marking, copying, killing, duplicating, transforming, deleting) of Emacs.
;;   Included are interfaces for rectangle, register, macro, and project
;;   commands.

;; - Elisp (Elisp library: `casual-elisp.el')
;;   An interface for `emacs-lisp-mode'. It provides a menu for commands useful
;;   for Elisp development.

;; - Eshell (Elisp library: `casual-eshell.el')
;;   An interface for Eshell, a shell-like command interpreter implemented in
;;   Emacs Lisp.

;; - Help (Elisp library: `casual-help.el')
;;   An interface for `help-mode', a major mode for viewing help text and
;;   navigating references in it.

;; - IBuffer (Elisp library: `casual-ibuffer.el')
;;   An interface to Emacs IBuffer, a mode designed for managing buffers.

;; - Image (Elisp library: `casual-image.el')
;;   An interface for viewing an image file with `image-mode'.
;;   Resizing an image is supported if ImageMagick 6 or 7 is installed. This
;;   interface deviates significantly with naming conventions used by
;;   `image-mode' to be more in alignment with conventional image editing tools.

;; - Info (Elisp library: `casual-info.el')
;;   An interface for the Info documentation system.

;; - I-Search (Elisp library: `casual-isearch.el')
;;   An interface for the many commands supported by I-Search.

;; - Make (Elisp library: `casual-make.el')
;;   An interface to `make-mode'.

;; - Man (Elisp library: `casual-man.el')
;;   An interface to `Man-mode', the Emacs Man page reader.

;; - Re-Builder (Elisp library: `casual-re-builder.el')
;;   An interface for the Emacs regular expression tool.

;; - Timezone (Elisp library: `casual-timezone.el')
;;   A library of commands to work with different time zones.

;; INSTALLATION

;; Users can choose any or all of the user interfaces made available by Casual
;; at their pleasure.

;; Configuration of a particular Casual user interface is performed per mode.
;; For details, refer to the Info node `(casual) Install'.

;; Casual relies on the latest stable release of `transient' which may differ
;; from the version that is preinstalled as a built-in. By b default, `package.el'
;; will not upgrade a built-in package. Set the customizable variable
;; `package-install-upgrade-built-in' to `t' to override this. For more details,
;; please refer to the "Install" section on this project's repository web page.

;;; Code:
(require 'package)
(require 'casual-lib)

(defun casual-upgrade-base-to-version-2 (enable)
  "Upgrade base Casual packages to version 2 if ENABLE is t.

Use this command to migrate your current Casual version 1.x
packages to the consolidated organization of version 2.x.

This will delete the following packages:

casual-agenda, casual-bookmarks, casual-calc, casual-dired,
casual-editkit, casual-ibuffer, casual-info, casual-isearch,
casual-re-builder, casual-lib.

Note that the package casual-lib will not be deleted if any of the packages
casual-suite, casual-avy, or casual-symbol-overlay is installed."
